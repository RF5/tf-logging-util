# tf-logging-util
#### A quick and easy utility for setting tensorflow's level of output logging

### Usage


### Why was this needed?
Long story short, I couldn't find the answers I was looking for easily online and each answer seemed to only work on some versions or environments, so I decided to just make a single, easy to find and use utility which will work for a lot of tensorflow versions. So it probably wasn't necessary - it isn't too hard to dig deep and find the 2 lines you need to include in your tensorflow project with its versioning, but if you stumble upon this before you find those two lines, this utility will work too.
